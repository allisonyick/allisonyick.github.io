            This is an interview with Kayla Areglado, a Culture and Media major at The New School. This zine first covers <a href="page1.html" class="topic topic-1">general thoughts</a> on foreign films, then dives into questions following the recent 2018 release of Crazy Rich Asians. Topics include the following: <a href="page2.html" class="topic topic-2">Portrayal of asians in film/media</a>, when they are not being pinned as the stereotypical math genius. <a href="page3.html" class="topic topic-3">How asians were represented then versus now</a>, and this touches upon standards of what they look for in actors/actresses when casting. And overall, <a href="page4.html" class="topic topic-4">asian recognition in the film industry</a> and the progression of recognition for foreign filmmakers and directors.
