      <div class="question">
        How are asians represented in film now versus in the past? (i.e. take the casting of Scarlett Johansson for the lead in Ghost in the Shell as an example)
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        There has definitely been more of a push to represent and cast Asians in mainstream films. I think that one of the things that made it difficult before was that it was much more difficult to find actors who can play these roles. With the way media is structured and integrated into culture/society today, there are a lot more resources to help find the right people for specific roles. With films like Ghost in the Shell, where they take an Asian character and story to bring into the Western film industry, I think it’s more of a result of having to cater to a particular audience in a particular region. Nowadays, part of the default nature of films and other forms of mainstream media is that they are to be seen and  accessed from all over the world, which pushed the movement to properly represent minorities even further. However, while there has been more of a movement to bring Asians into the mainstream film industry, there is still the issue of only representing a specific “type” of Asian. As someone who is from the Philippines, and therefore Asian, I often think about the fact that when people think of “Asians”, they think about light-skinned, small eyed, Asians, which basically only describes East Asians.

      <div class="question">
        Kevin Kwan mentioned in an interview that back in 2013, a producer approached him on casting a white woman for the role of Rachel Chu. Do you think that whitewashing in the film industry has gotten better since then or is this still a huge part of Hollywood’s mindset?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        It has definitely gotten better, but I still think that whitewashing in the Western film industry is still a prevalent issue. While there are less cases of whitewashing recently, I have definitely seen that Western audiences themselves can still show ignorance towards Asian cast members, either by still saying that there is no need to cast Asians, or by discrediting their work in a Hollywood setting. Hollywood wants to satisfy their audience, and if the audience asks for whitewashing, then they will be more in favor of doing so. When it comes to reboots of Asian movies (ex. Ghost in the Shell anime vs live-action, Shutter 2004 vs Hollywood 2008)*, whitewashing and the erasure of certain key elements that are particular to the original is part of the transition and adaptation to the American audience, and I don’t think that will change unless the audience changes their mindset as well.

      <div class="question">
        Does this underrepresentation have to do with beauty standards or “not having the right image” – what is the right image?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        The representation of Asians in films changes the image of Asians both in the Western film industry and in Asia. Because of how Asians have been represented in the past, we are oftentimes associated with being the “model minority”, but at the same time, the West’s image of Asians mostly encompasses only East Asians. The existence of the “right” image of Asians is a result of the industry that falsely represents Asians to begin with. I think that the underrepresentation as well as the existence of the “right image” of Asians (or any racial minority) in the Western film industry is heavily influenced by the systems of racial hierarchy that have been embedded into society in the past.
