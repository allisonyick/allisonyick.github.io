  <p>Artie Vierkant's Image Objects was a body of sculptural works that existed between the physical object and the mediated digital image, and through their existence highlighted the increasingly fluid boundary between the two. The series was contextualized with a PDF essay on the topic by Vierkant, which was published on the curatorial platform JstChillin.org.

  The sculptures responded to a moment in which contemporary art audiences began to experience exhibitions primarily through its online representation. For Vierkant, this moment marked a decisive shift in the definition of the work of art, which now included these online images as well as any further variations generated by audiences.
  <br><br> 
  With the Image Objects series, Vierkant engaged with these questions by printing image-based works to appear three-dimensional, and circulating digitally manipulated documentation of them online. On a whole, Image Objects, the sculptures, images, and writing, shaped the emerging discussion around postinternet art.</p>
