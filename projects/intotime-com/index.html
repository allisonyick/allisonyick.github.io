  <h1>IntoTime.Com</h1>
  <p>Initially created in 2010 with Flash, and later migrated to JavaScript, Rafaël Rozendaal’s <a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/intotime-com">into time .com</a> marks the artist’s crucial shift from figurative to abstract browser-based compositions.
  <br><br>
  into time .com is one of more than 100 “single-serving” websites created by Rozendaal, each of which offers a simple, usually interactive experience that fills the browser window and bears a dedicated domain name as its title. This approach, honed in the early 2000s as part of the “Neen” movement, has allowed Rozendaal to compile study after study of the browser’s potential for aesthetics and play. into time .com represents one significant moment within this years-long investigation.</p>
